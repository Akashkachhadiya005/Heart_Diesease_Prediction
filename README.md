# Heart_Diesease_Prediction
Heart_Disease_Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the presence of heart disease using various clinical and demographic features. It supports early diagnosis and preventive healthcare interventions.

## **Bussiness Case:-Heart Diesease Predicition**

### Based on the gives features whether the patient has heart diesease or not

* Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.

* People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management.

## Features Information

1. **Sex**
      - Gender affects heart disease risk, with men at higher risk at younger ages and womenâ€™s risk increasing after menopause.
2. **Age**
      - Older age increases the likelihood and severity of heart disease.
3. **Thalassemia (thal)**
      - Thalassemia is linked to blood disorders that may increase heart disease risk.
4. **Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment**
      - A negative slope indicates heart stress, often due to ischemia or coronary artery disease.
5. **Resting Blood Pressure**
      - High blood pressure is a key risk factor for heart disease.
6. **Chest Pain Type**
      - Chest pain type helps in diagnosing heart disease, with typical angina being a strong indicator.
7. **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy**
      - Fewer vessels with normal flow suggest a higher risk of heart disease.
8. **Fasting Blood Sugar > 120 mg/dL**
      - High blood sugar suggests diabetes, which significantly raises heart disease risk.
9. **Resting EKG Results**
      - EKG abnormalities (arrhythmias, previous heart attack) help diagnose heart disease.
10. **Serum Cholesterol**
      - High cholesterol contributes to artery plaque buildup, increasing heart disease risk.
11. **Oldpeak (ST Depression Induced by Exercise)**
      - ST depression during exercise indicates heart strain and potential ischemia.
12. **Max Heart Rate Achieved**
     - A low maximum heart rate during exercise suggests poor heart health.
13. **Exercise-Induced Angina**
      - Chest pain during exercise is a sign of heart strain and possible coronary artery disease.
14. **Heart Disease Present**
      - This is the target variable for predicting the presence of heart disease.
